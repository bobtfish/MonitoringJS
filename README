MonitoringJS

The entire project (excluding icon files) is inlined into index.html in the root
directory for speed of loading.

A test server is provided in 'server', which will run a PSGI server hosting the
application and a sensible set of demonstration data.

The un-compacted version of the site (for debugging or development) can be viewed
using the development server at the path /dev/. This page uses the un-compacted
source located in maint/app.html, and the un-minified Javascript in the js/ directory

To re-build the inlined versions of the application, see instructions in the maint/
directory.
